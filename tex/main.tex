\chapter{Description}
This report describes the database design created for the company We Do Secure (WDS), used to help WDS deal with recently expanded operation on offering Auto and Home insurance to their customers. The database provides the function to store information required by WDS of customer, policy, home, auto, auto driver, customer payment and invoice. Moreover, the database design indicates the relationship between these entities clearly. The detailed design and assumptions are explained in the following pages. The robustness of the database is proved by generating sample data and several practice SQL queries with flexibility. Our model can hold complex situations such as multiple homes and autos for one customer. All the previous records of a customer are stored. Our model also supports multiple drivers for multiple autos. There are more features for our model. For further information, the corresponding codes and results are shown in next sections.


\chapter{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A customer has only two subtypes, auto-customer(acustomer) and home-customer (hcustomer).
    \item A customer has to be either acustomer or hcustomer, or both.
    \item An hcustomer can have multiple homes, and each home can have multiple home insurance policies.
    \item An acustomer can have multiple autos, and each auto can have multiple auto insurance policies.
    \item An auto may can have multiple drivers and a driver can drive multiple cars.
    \item A driver is distinct from a customer in the database.
    \item An hpolicy for a home can have multiple payments, i.e., installments.
    \item An apolicy for an auto can have multiple payments, i.e., installments.
    \item An hpolicy for a home only generate one invoice.
    \item An apolicy for an auto only generate one invoice.
    \item Multiple payments for a certain hpolicy for a home correspond to one invoice.
    \item Multiple payments for a certain apolicy for an auto correspond to one invoice.
    \item Each payment corresponds to either home policy or auto policy but cannot be both.
    \item A policy has only two subtypes, auto-policy(apolicy) and home-policy(hpolicy).
    \item A policy has to be either apolicy or hpolicy, but cannot be both.
\end{enumerate}

    FROM AUTO A INNER JOIN DRIVER_AUTO B ON
    A.vin = B.vin
    INNER JOIN DRIVER C ON
    B.licenseNum = C.licenseNum
\end{lstlisting}

    SELECT homeID, purchasedate, purchasevalue, area 
    FROM home 
    WHERE homeID IN
    (
    SELECT homeID 
    FROM home_hpolicy 
    WHERE status = 'C'

\subsection{Q4: SET operator query}
Select query: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT policyID 
    FROM HPOLICY
    INTERSECT
    SELECT policyID
